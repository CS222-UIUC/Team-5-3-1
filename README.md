# Team-5-3-1

Introduction

What is the 5-3-1 restaurant picker? 

Our website 5-3-1 helps users find and choose restaurants. Given a location, search radius, and restaurant-specific parameters, 5-3-1 randomly generates 5 restaurants. Users are prompted to select 3 restaurants. 5-3-1 then randomly picks 1 restaurant
